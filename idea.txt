I want to build a mobile app that can scan the groceries
 that you are buying from
  supermarkets and keep that data like the inspiring date,
   price and so on stored, and can use a telegram or
    WhatsApp chat to notify you if something is going bad, 
    rotten or give monthly statistic on how much was
     paid for what  and so on,  and on top of that can
      maybe suggest shopping lists, notifying if we are 
      going to need something for example for breakfast
      
     tomorrow we will need to by milk and bread today.. 
     like a chatbot that keeps track of all the shopping 
     and can write the user an email or on
      watsapp or telegram or any other messaging platform,
       or email servise and advise them on shoping..
